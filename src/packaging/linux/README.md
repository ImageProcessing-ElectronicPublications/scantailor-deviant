     ├─ debian/
     ├─ src/
     ... 
     ├─ CMakeLists.txt
     ...

~~~less
cmake\
 -S ./src\
 -B ./build\
 -D CPACK_GENERATOR:STRING="DEB;TGZ"\
 -D ENABLE_EXIV2:BOOL=ON\
 -D ENABLE_OPENJPEG:BOOL=ON

cmake\
 -S ./src\
 -B ./build\
 -D CPACK_GENERATOR:STRING="DEB;TGZ"\
 -D ENABLE_EXIV2:BOOL=OFF\
 -D ENABLE_OPENJPEG:BOOL=OFF
